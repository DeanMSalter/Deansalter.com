            <h2>Stannah Full Stack Java Developer -  July 2019 - Present </h2>
            <p>The role at Stannah involves working on internal business software.
                This primarily required the use of Ofbiz and an MVC framework.
                This allowed me to apply my previous experience to a more commercial environment, and be part of more strict office culture.
            </p>
            <p>I have been tasked with completing 2 major projects from the initial formation phase right up to the implementation.
                One of these was a text messaging system designed to improve the way the business communicated with customers,
                the other was implementing email management across the entire business to ensure that all emails were accurately
                logged against content within the business. </p>
            <p>These both involved conducting multiple meetings with the users,
                from multiple different departments, to acquire the requirements. Then create the product using skills I had
                previously no experience with while conducting MVP meetings throughout the process. As well as doing all the work
                on the backend and frontend, this involved extensive API knowledge and exploring different areas of computing.
                The email project especially involved acquiring hardware (Linux mail servers), working on security,
                storage issues as well as fundamental problems such as how to identify the meaning of an email.</p>
            <p>Alongside these larger projects, I had the day to day responsibilities which involved quick turnaround on multiple tasks a day</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Familiarity with popular tools such as Jira, Bitbucket, Gitlab, Git, Docker, Slack, Confluence</li>
                <li>Prioritising crucial bug fixes and features over other less crucial tasks</li>
                <li>Communicating with the testing team daily to ensure reliable releases</li>
                <li>The importance of reporting any bugs and issues to my project manager quickly and clearly</li>
                <li>Working in a small department based team as well as a larger developer team</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>FunDK: February 2013 - September 2018</h2>
            <span>
                FunDK was a large gaming community primarily focused around our own custom game mode that had 100,000 members at its peak.
                It involved maintaining multiple servers and responding to requests from the users as well as planned updates and improvements.
            </span>

                <h4>Head Developer FunDK: August 2016 - September 2018</h4>
                <p>
                    My primary responsibility in this role was to update the codebase to be less bloated and more efficient.
                    This was to allow for more features to be added. Alongside this, I was tasked with managing the other developers and projects.
                    This helped me develop my leadership skills as well as my ability to manage multiple projects.
                </p>
                <p>Some of my other duties included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managing and delegating to the development team of 5 members who were based all over the world.</li>
                    <li>Organising meetings that work with the different time zones that each member was in on a regular basis.</li>
                    <li>
                        Developing time management skills as this role required 2-3 hours of engagement every day during most of the year,
                        this was on top of uni work and part-time work. During peak periods it requires 7-8 hours of engagement every day,
                        often in unsociable hours due to timezone issues.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h4>Head of Community Engagement FunDK: September 2013 - September 2018</h4>
                <p>
                    This role was created during the peak of our community.
                    It was becoming clear we needed to manage the needs of the users and ensure the team remained consistent when dealing with problems.

                <p>
                    This position allowed me to apply my theoretical and hobbyist knowledge to an active codebase.
                    Primarily it involved working on features for users which they directly interacted with.
                    This meant I was in a unique position to monitor what users wanted and respond directly to their needs.
